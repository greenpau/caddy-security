## Development Environment

The contribution to this project requires setting up a development
environment. The following steps allow developers to test their
setup using local source code.

First, designate directory for building, e.g. `tmpdev`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tmpdev
cd ~/tmpdev
```

Second, fork the following repositories in Github into to your own Github
handle, e.g. `anonymous`:

* `https://github.com/andrewsonpradeep/caddy-security` => `https://github.com/anonymous/caddy-security`
* `https://github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch` => `https://github.com/anonymous/go-authcrunch`

Provided you are in `tmpdev` directory, clone the forked repositories:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:anonymous/caddy-security.git
git clone git@github.com:anonymous/go-authcrunch.git
```

Next, browse to `caddy-security` and run the following `make` command to install
various dependencies:

```bash
cd caddy-security
make dep
```

Next, modify `go.mod` in `github.com/andrewsonpradeep/caddy-security`. Include
`replace` directives to instruct `go` using local directories, as opposed
to follow Github versions.

Note: the referenced versions must match.

```
module github.com/andrewsonpradeep/caddy-security

go 1.16

require (
    github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch v1.0.40
)

replace github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch v1.0.40 => /home/greenpau/dev/go/src/github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch
```

Then, modify `Makefile` such that that replacement passes to `xcaddy` builder:

```bash
        @mkdir -p ../xcaddy-$(PLUGIN_NAME) && cd ../xcaddy-$(PLUGIN_NAME) && \
                xcaddy build $(CADDY_VERSION) --output ../$(PLUGIN_NAME)/bin/caddy \
                --with github.com/andrewsonpradeep/caddy-security@$(LATEST_GIT_COMMIT)=$(BUILD_DIR) \
                --with github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch@v1.0.40=/home/greenpau/dev/go/src/github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch
```

Once all the necessary packages are installed, you should be ready to compile
using the local source code. Run:

```bash
make
```

The above make command creates `xcaddy-caddy-security` directory in `tmpdev`.
Then, it starts building `caddy` and referencing locally sources plugins.

After the build, the resultant binary will be in `bin/` directory.
You can then test it with your own configuration files.

```bash
bin/caddy run -config assets/config/Caddyfile | jq
```

Additionally, you should be able to run tests:

```bash
make ctest
```
